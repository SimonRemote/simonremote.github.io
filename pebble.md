# Pebble Quickstart

This allows one to control many aspects of their Mac from the SimonRemote Pebble app. It requires the [companion application](https://github.com/simonremote/simon-mac) installed on the Mac computer. 

SimonRemote app should work in most scenarios (Wifi, 3G, 4G, etc), however, if the Pebble app (on the phone) is backgrounded, the watch won't update information automatically. That is what the *refresh* button is for in the features list. 

## Setup

Note: The Pebble app has not been submitted to the Pebble App Store yet, so I have only listed instructions for installing from source.

1. Install from the Pebble App Store ([Click Here!](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54166746ba06e4e0db000073)) 
5. In the configuration page, enter the "Channel" given in the menubar dropdown from the Mac application and click 'Submit'
