In this case that is data from the Pebble to the Mac and vice versa. \r\n\r\nSome existing solutions already exist to some degree:\r\n\r\n- [Pebble Slides](https://github.com/luisivan/pebble-slides)\r\n- [Joseph Schmitt's solution](http://joe.sh/using-pebble-control-mac)\r\n- [libpebble](https://github.com/Hexxeh/libpebble)\r\n\r\nHowever, there are downfalls to each. Pebble Slides solution is limited to controlling a computer's keyboard and forces the user to run a python server and deal with ports. The last two both use libpebble, which is connecting the Pebble directly to the Mac using Bluetooth, which isn't reliable and also is inconvinient for the end user.\r\n\r\n## Benefits of my solution\r\n### A few easy steps.\r\n\r\n1. Load up the application and click on the menu bar icon. Take note of channel code\r\n\r\n    ![](http://i.imgur.com/nUC50gL.png)\r\n\r\n2. Go to the Pebble application under SimonRemote's settings page and enter that code. Click Submit\r\n\r\n    ![](http://i.imgur.com/zMIUhzi.png)\r\n\r\n3. Load the Pebble app and control.\r\n\r\n    ![](http://i.imgur.com/J2DIfbx.png)\r\n    ![](http://i.imgur.com/WtKslFR.png)\r\n\r\n### Network indifferent\r\n\r\nMy solution will work over any type of internet connection since both clients connect simultaneously to the server. There is no requirement to open ports or be on the same network. Clients can disconnect and connect as they choose and restore sessions.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Applications\r\n\r\nThe Pebble application being developed currently will be released with support for the following applications\r\n\r\n- iTunes\r\n- Spotify\r\n- Rdio\r\n- Keynote\r\n- PowerPoint\r\n- VLC\r\n\r\nAdding more is easy.\r\n\r\n### Two-Way Communication\r\n\r\nThe server has the ability to send information in both directions, so when you change a song on the Pebble, the next song will be updated on the screen instantly.\r\n\r\n## Future ideas \r\n### All applications\r\n- Choose computer?\r\n\r\n### PowerPoint & Keynote\r\n- Notes fetching/displaying\r\n- Force next/previous slide (skip animation events)\r\n\r\n### VLC\r\n- Do it\r\n\r\n## Projects Used\r\n\r\n- [WebSocket-Node](https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node)\r\n- [Popup](https://github.com/shpakovski/Popup)\r\n- [SkipStone](https://github.com/Skipstone/Skipstone) (for reference)","google":"UA-50879604-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
